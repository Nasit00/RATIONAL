# Rational Numbers with GCD & LCM
# ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project provides a Rational class to represent fractions with automatic simplification. It supports arithmetic operations, string formatting, and utilities for computing GCD and LCM. Helper functions gcd and lcm are implemented separately and used within the class. A UML diagram illustrates the design.
